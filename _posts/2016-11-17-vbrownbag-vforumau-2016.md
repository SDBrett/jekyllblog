&nbsp;

During the Sydney vForum, vBrownBag was present producing tech talks. Tech talks are a way for community members to present a short talk on a subject of their choosing.

&nbsp;

We will upload recorded talks to YouTube after recording. Also where possible, we will live stream talks on [vBrownBag.com](http://vBrownBag.com).

If you would like to watch any of the vBrownBag videos, visit our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaZf13iWhwnBdpIkrEmHLbA/playlists).
