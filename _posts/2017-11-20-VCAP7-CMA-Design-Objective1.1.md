Holding workshops with business stakeholders is usually the primary method of gathering business requirements. As a consultant it is important to have an agenda and list of goals prior to commencing a workshop to help them stay on track. Unplanned workshops have a very real possibility of running off track an losing their value.

The stakeholders that you will need to meet with and workshops required will depend on the type of engagement that you're on. For example, if you need to design for a few VM deployments, it's more likely that you'll primarily talk to line managers and application owners. 

If your project is to deploy a greenfield cross cloud solution, you'll probably need to talk C-Levels through to line managers.

#### Stakeholders

Stakeholder interviews vary greatly between businesses and sometimes engagements within the same business. When creating a design to solve a problem, it can be helpful to reaffirm previous descisions.

#### Functional and Non-Funtional Requirements

There are two different types of requirements, functional and non-functional. 
Functional requirements describe what the design must achieve and parameters around that. A functional requirement could be; speed up the deployment of development environments. Or, show environment cost.

Non-functional requirements describe how the design will accomplish the goals. These will become constraints later in the design process. Development environments can only be deployed on AWS. A developer can only have 2 Development environments. 

#### Real World Learnings

Workshops can easily run on to a tangent, clearly defining a set of outcomes to be met helps the process. This is not to say you'll get all the answers to your questions, but it can help.

Make sure to clearly communicate in advance the purpose of the workshop and the topics that will be covered, this provides attendees to prepare ahead of time.

Follow up workshops and link requirements back to possible impacts on the final design early. It's easier to change things at the start before you've started implementation.
