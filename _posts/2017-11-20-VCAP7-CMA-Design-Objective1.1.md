Holding workshops with business stakeholders is usually the primary method of gathering business requirements. As a consultant it is important to have an agenda and list of goals prior to commencing a workshop to help them stay on track. Unplanned workshops have a very real possibility of running off track an losing their value.

The stakeholders that you will need to meet with and workshops required will depend on the type of engagement that you're on. For example, if you need to design for a few VM deployments, it's more likely that you'll primarily talk to line managers and application owners. 

If your project is to deploy a greenfield cross cloud solution, you'll probably need to talk C-Levels through to line managers.
