The SDBrett blog is the personal blog of Brett Johnson, I started this blog in 2015 to help myself study for the Cisco CCNA R/S certification. I found that I enjoyed the writing process and that it was beneficial for my own development.

Many of the articles on this site are written as part of my own self-education process to help the knowledge stick. Other pieces are the result challenges that I have come across where the answer was not readily available at the time.

These days my focus is on infrastructure automation and helping clients integrate new automation workflows into their operational model. 

I work for a vendor, but, all posts on this site are my own.
