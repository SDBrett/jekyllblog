# VCAP7 CMA Design Study Guide

This page is dedicated to providing information for the VCAP7-CMA Design exam.
If you've read previous posts that I've written about study, you'll know that I'm a firm beleiver that learning only happens when we have context.
As such, I have started by creating a problem to be solved. This can be found under the 'use case' link below. This will provide context to the objectives and help provide relevance to the information provided.

As objectives such as 1.1 'Gather and Analyze Business Requirements' are addressed, the use case will be updated. So be sure to refer back as required.
In addition, documentation in addition to the blog posts will be created and made available.
